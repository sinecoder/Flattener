# Flattener
## Flattener VST3 Plugin
Welcome to the Flattener Plugin, my third app developed by integrating the functional programming language Faust with JUCE. An envelope flattener is similar to an automatic gain control, compressor, or maximizer in that it acts by modifying the gain of the signal according to a control signal. Like these, the control signal is derived from the envelope of the input signal. For sound design, music production, and experimentation.
